A full stack web application for travelers who want to blog about their adventures.

## Purpose of this Project

As an avid traveler and someone who loves a good adventure I have always wished that there was a better way to share my traveling stories with the world. I love being able to learn about other people's adventures to give me inspiration on where I want to travel to in the future. I created this website to be a unique experience of being able to share life stories from places all over the world.
